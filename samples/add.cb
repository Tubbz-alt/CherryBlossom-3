i can hear the birds
caressed by warmth of the sun
dreaming of summer

dreaming that I am
contemplating in rainfall
about all my loss

freezing, desolate.
lonely desert in winter
all is forgotten

autumn is ahead
the winter is returning.
and it conquers all.

how can the rainfall
so beautify the hillside
that was so barren

returning rainfall
sings as it falls to the earth
and all is alive
